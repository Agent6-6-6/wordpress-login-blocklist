# Wordpress Login Blocklist
 IP blocklist based on IP's failing multiple attempts and being banned from logging into my WordPress admin login, also includes IP's of people constantly spamming non-relevant comments.

### Update
As of January 2022 the list generation is fully automated blocking anyone and everyone who tries and fails to login to WordPress, prior to this it was a manual process to extract and collate the offending IP's (when I remembered basically) so lots of attempt no doubt slipped through being recorded and blocked long term. 

The scripts are run at 05:55 NZT and 11:55 NZT, so set your blocklist to update hourly or daily to pickup the latest IP changes.
